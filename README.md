# Sugar Pin

## About This Project

Sugar Pin is a tool which allows diabetics to track daily blood sugar levels in a convenient app.  Pins are dropped into a graph displaying trends throughout the day.  High and low norms are listed aswell, any levels which are out of these norms will prompt a gentle suggestion.  Users are able to search and edit past data as well.

## Dependencies used

* 

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command from the terminal:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
